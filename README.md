Privacy-preserving blockchain applications are designed to protect user data and transaction details while maintaining the benefits of blockchain technology, such as transparency, security, and decentralization. The blockchain application will allow voters to register securely on the blockchain, ensuring that only eligible voters can participate in the election and allow voters to cast their votes without revealing their identity, preserving their privacy while ensuring the integrity of the vote. Votes are recorded on the blockchain, making them immutable and resistant to tampering or fraud.
